# tree-visualizer
Displays a visual representation of a binary search tree that supports find, insert, and remove operations.
Reads in integer values and places them in their proper position in a binary search tree. Can also remove 
given integers from the tree while keeping proper ordering of the tree. Can find given integers in the tree
and trace their path from the root node by bolding the edges, as well as colouring the nodes in the path
different colours depending on whether they are greater than, less than, or equal to the found node.
